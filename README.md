## How To Write Code for this Project

Writing code should be done with the UniLibrary folder as the root within vscode.

Before running the Program.cs file this command should be run in your terminal:`dotnet dev-certs https --trust`
**Note!!! This command will only work on Windows. If using Linux see your specific Linux distribution's documentation for trusting a certificate.**
